This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## I On You Review & Reputation System
**Designed | Developed | Deployed by Christopher Cialone for Rosalone Labs**
* What started as a Chainlink Block Magic Hackathon Project has taken on a life of it's own
Full Dev Docs found on GitBook: *https://rosalone-labs.gitbook.io/rosalone-labs*
The I On You Review reputation system is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to empower users by providing detailed and specific industry-related information about businesses, enabling them to align with companies that share their values. By leveraging blockchain technology, Chainlink services, and IPFS, the system ensures transparency, reliability, and security. Businesses that actively address user feedback are rewarded with tokenized incentives, fostering a responsive and accountable business environment
